## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd angularjs-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Run the following command to install the required packages:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   You can use a local server to serve the `index.html` file. For example, you can use the `http-server` package:
   ```
   npx http-server src
   ```

4. **Open your browser**:
   Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` (or the port specified by your server) to view the application.

## Usage Guidelines

- The application is structured using AngularJS, which allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive web applications.
- The main module is defined in `app.module.js`, where you can add dependencies as needed.
- Controllers are defined in `app.controller.js`, where you can manage the application's data and user interactions.
- Components are encapsulated in `app.component.js`, allowing for reusable UI elements.
- Place any image assets in the `src/assets/img` directory for use in the application.
